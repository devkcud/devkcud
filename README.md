## 🧠 About Me

I'm a full-stack developer with a backend bias and a tendency to automate anything I touch. Currently working as lead dev at Incube Metrics, where I build internal tools, tame cloud infra, and occasionally talk to humans.

I started coding when I was 9 (thanks, Pascal), and haven't stopped since. Now 18, I focus on crafting things I'd actually use. From CLI tools to web platforms to random Download Managers. When I'm not elbow-deep in Docker containers, I'm probably writing docs no one asked for, or breaking my system config for fun.

🏗️ Things I'm building: smarter internal systems, open source utilities, a download manager that does more than download stuff, and my coping mechanisms.

📋 Side Quests: learning Finnish, battling YAML, and pretending bash is a real language.

## 🤝 Let's Talk

I'm always open to contributing in random projects, contract work, full-time roles, or even weird conversations about Linux, life, or linguistics.

If you're looking for someone who:

- Writes clean code and has the audacity to document it
- Documents the hard and boring
- Makes the CLI do weird, useful, occasionally cursed things

Then yeah, let's talk.
