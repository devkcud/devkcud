## 🦆 Who I Am (and why you should care)

**TL;DR**: My work overlaps code, infra, UX, security, legal, docs, and whatever else has an open Jira card (I write them too).

> Check out my [Portfolio](https://www.devkcud.com) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-albanese-junior)!

- Promoted to lead dev at 18, building a B2B analytics platform used by 10,000+ enterprise users from Seara, Danone, Panco, Coty, Ruby Rose, and many more (yes, I'm name-dropping)
- Architected backend systems, automation pipelines, onboarding flows, and authored public-facing legal policy docs (I also handle the 100+ question security audits and client validation calls)
- Built solo Godot tools and FX systems used by indie devs
- Designed CLIs, dashboards, and internal utilities just to avoid clicking things manually
- Published things I'd actually use. Archived the rest. No regrets.

## 🧪 What I Build

I build things to do my job for me, document themselves (sometimes), and mostly don't delete the dev db (last incident 7/27/25).

- 🖥️ **Infra & Backend Systems**: Python, C#, cloud orchestration, and anti-suffering scripts
- 🎮 **Godot Engine Tools**: Custom shaders, particle FX, scripting modules
- 📊 **Dashboards & UI Stuff**: Built to survive stakeholders and product meetings
- 📋 **Legal & Docs**: Not cool. Not fun. But someone has to answer the 122-question security questionnaires at 2 AM
