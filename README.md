<h1 align="center">Greetings, I'm André "Pato" Albanese Junior 👋</h1>
<h2 align="center">🚀 Full-Stack Developer | <img height="20" src="icons/archlinux.svg"> Arch Linux user btw | 🦆 aka devkcud</h2>

I am a full-stack developer from Brazil 🇧🇷, with a strong focus on back-end development. I started coding at 9 with Pascal, and now, at 17 _(todo: Update this yearly)_, I am passionate about software development. My birthday is July 7, 2006 btw. 🎈

_I also have a keen interest in GPT (the partition layout 👀)_

### 📦️ Notable Projects

<details>
  <summary><a href="https://github.com/swibly/swibly-api">Swibly API</a>: A RESTful API for the Swibly project. Used primarily for auth and project management.</summary>
  <a href="https://www.swibly.com.br">View Deployment</a>
  
  <p><b>Problem:</b> What can I say? It's THE project so I can graduate. I must do it right! It was (and still is) difficult to learn, cause it's a huge project. Difficult enough? No. I was the one responsible (for some time until a friend decided to help) for the cloud and DNS.</p>
  
  <p><b>Technologies used:</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Golang</li>
    <li>Gin</li>
    <li>GORM</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>Render</li>
    <li>Supabase</li>
    <li>Docker</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><a href="https://github.com/devkcud/skill-icons-web">Skill Icons Web</a>: Unofficial "Image Builder" for Skill Icons.</summary>
  <a href="https://skill-icons-web.vercel.app">View Deployment</a>
  
  <p><b>Problem:</b> I wanted a website to easily manipulate Skill Icons, but couldn't find any that fits my needs. After some time, I decided to create my own.</p>
  
  <p><b>Technologies used:</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Sveltekit</li>
    <li>Typescript</li>
    <li>TailwindCSS + DaisyUI</li>
    <li>SortableJS</li>
    <li>Zod</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><a href="https://github.com/devkcud/Kubic">Kubic</a>: A logical cube-based game.</summary>
  <a href="#">No Deployments :(</a>
  
  <p><b>Problem:</b> Another one of those school projects. This one is special, it is my first FULL game. I never did anything like that before, and do this in such a tight deadline is a hard challenge that I took and it was amazing to work in.</p>
  
  <p><b>Technologies used:</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Gamemaker GML</li>
    <li>Scribble</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><a href="https://github.com/devkcud/mk">mk</a>: A tool to simplify folder and file creation.</summary>
  <a href="#">No Deployments :(</a>
  
  <p><b>Problem:</b> This one is the one. The one that I'm proud of. A simple yet the command that I use the most in my Linux system. Creating a complete CLI tool is a fun thing to do. It was difficult, I didn't knew how to work with files in Go, and this project helped me understand a LOT about buffers, files, flags, and a lot of other things.</p>
  
  <p><b>Technologies used:</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Golang</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><a href="https://github.com/devkcud/mutare">mutare</a>: A markdown editor developed for a school project.</summary>
  <a href="https://devkcud.github.io/mutare/">View Deployment</a>
  
  <p><b>Problem:</b> Yet another school project. I made this one with a friend of mine, and it was good. The only problem is that we had one week to do all of it, so don't expect a lot of extensibility or it be responsive on mobile.</p>
  
  <p><b>Technologies used:</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>HTML5</li>
    <li>CSS3</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
  </ul>

<details>
  <summary><a href="https://github.com/devkcud/duckos">duckos</a>: An old ReactJS portfolio of my work.</summary>
  <a href="https://duckos.vercel.app">View Deployment</a>
  
  <p><b>Problem:</b> I wanted to learn React, and decided to create an OS-sim website. The only problem was <i>how?</i> Then I forced my self to learn React draggable in 4 weeks, many projects were lost during that time.</p>
  
  <p>Technologies used:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>Typescript</li>
    <li>SASS</li>
